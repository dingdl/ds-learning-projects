# My data science learning projects

This repo contains all the projects that I have done to improve my data science skills. Most of them are the course projects from my Udacity programs.

## [01-donar-search](https://github.com/dingdl/ds-learning-projects/blob/master/01-donar-search/main.ipynb) 
The goal of this project is to identify potential donors. From a machine learning perspective, it boils downs to a small practice of **classification**. Specifically, the goal is to construct a model that can predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000. Therefore, I tried a couple of **supervised learning** algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and Adaboost. It turns out that Adaboost performed best as a ensemble method.
